# JapanStock

Hello there!🙌

I'm thrilled to introduce my latest project powered by React.js. This endeavor posed quite the challenge for me as a junior developer, but I'm genuinely delighted with the final outcome.

I crafted a website dedicated to showcasing captivating photos and videos from across Japan, where users can seamlessly make purchases. My creative journey began with the design phase, where I crafted three distinct pages using Figma. Subsequently, I brought these designs to life through the art of coding, implementing all three pages using React.

The resulting website boasts full responsiveness, adapting flawlessly to various devices, ensuring an effortless and enjoyable browsing experience. Navigating through the pages and searching for your desired Japanese city has never been more user-friendly.

I invite you to explore this digital gateway to Japan's visual wonders, and I'm excited to hear your thoughts on the project!

Home Page:

This is where my project begins 🍡.
In this page we can find an interactive search bar where the user can choose to search Photos, Videos or both!
The user just needs to type a city around Japan and search 🗾.
In the main section we can find a mosaic grid with different photos around Japan and they're all clickable that leads the user to the product page .
We can also see a link section with Pouplaar areas and a footer with all the important things we need.

Results Page:

In this page we find a grid with the results from the serach in the searchbar and they're all collected from the Pexels API. 🏯
The data here can be either photos, videos or both, which all depends on what was selected on the search bar.
The map shown on the right side is interactive and showcases the location of the search queried by the user. 🗺️

Product Page:

This is where the user can acquire the photo or video. 
The data shown on this page is all fetched from the previous page, including the alt text (showcased on the title), photographer name and the image itself. 
The image is also clickable, which opens a pop-up for the user to further analyze the item. 📸.

OTHER DETAILS:

Unfortunately because of the use of the Pexel API I can't show this on vercel or any other similiar applications. I tried everything I could but they have rules that make it not possible 🥲
